# Quiz Game

## Description

 The Game presents True/False questions to the user and provides instant feedback on their answers. It keeps track of the user's score throughout the quiz.

## Features

- **Question Bank:** The Game has a predefined set of True/False questions stored in a separate data file.
- **User Interaction:** Users interact with the Game through a command-line interface (CLI). They input their answers to each question, and the app provides immediate feedback.
- **Scoring:** The app keeps track of the user's score as they progress through the quiz.
- **Completion Message:** Upon completing the quiz, the user receives a summary of their performance, including the final score.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- **Main Script:** `main.py` contains the main logic for running the quiz, including initializing questions, managing user input, and displaying results.
- **Question Model:** The `question_model.py` file defines the `Question` class, which represents individual quiz questions.
- **Data:** The `data.py` file stores the question data in a structured format (list of dictionaries).
- **Quiz Brain:** The `quiz_brain.py` module contains the `QuizBrain` class, which manages the flow of the quiz, checks answers, and tracks the score.
